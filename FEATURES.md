# Clawdia — Features Worth Sharing

## Your Logins Are The API
No API keys for GitHub, Gmail, AWS, or any service. Your browser sessions ARE the authentication. Log in once, Claude uses your cookies. Every website you have an account on becomes a tool.

## Live HTML Streaming
Claude streams HTML directly into the browser panel as it writes. Real-time interactive prototypes that render while being built. You watch the page construct itself live.

## Self-Teaching
Asked to screenshot the desktop with zero prior knowledge. Searched the web, found the tool, installed it, wrote the script — 28 seconds, first try. No plugins needed.

## Full Local System Access
Unrestricted bash, file read/write/edit, process management. No sandbox. Install packages, run builds, manage git, automate anything.

## Session Cookie Sharing
Your logged-in accounts are accessible to Claude. GitHub PRs, Gmail inbox, AWS console, Jira boards — no re-authentication, no API keys.

## Document Workflow
Drag PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets into chat. Claude reads them. It also generates DOCX, PDF, XLSX with one-click download.

## 3 Claude Models
Haiku (fast/cheap), Sonnet (balanced), Opus (powerful). Switch mid-conversation. All have identical tool access.

## AppImage Distribution
Single-file Linux install. 159 MB. Download, chmod +x, run. No Node.js, no npm, no setup.
